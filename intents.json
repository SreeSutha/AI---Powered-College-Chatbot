At the same time, Pt HN Kunzru formed sub-committees which were sent on study tours in all the main provinces of pre-independent India including provinces which are now located in Bangladesh and Pakistan. One sub-committee was also sent on tour to Great Britain and France from 15 Feb 1947 to 31 Mar 1947 to study the Youth and Cadet organisations in those countries.\n The Cadet Corps Committee carried out exhaustive study of the problem of youth in India. Its sub-committees after their tour at home and abroad submitted their report to the Govt of India in Mar 1947. Soon after the report was submitted, a far reaching political development began to impact the country, due to which the Cadet Corps Scheme had to be kept in abeyance. The religious strife which then was at its zenith, ultimately led to the partition of the country into India and Pakistan.\n On the stroke of midnight of 14/15 Aug 1947, India achieved her independence. Immediately after independence, India was confronted with problems of formidable magnitude concerning not only repatriation of millions of displaced persons from Pakistan but also a full scale invasion of Kashmir by the Armed tribesmen supported by Pakistan. The armed forces had to rush to retrieve Kashmir at a time when they were already pre-occupied with the internal problem of maintaining law and order during the country's initial stage of consolidation.\n The war in Kashmir and the consequent loss of a portion of Indian territory; the open support of Western Powers to Pakistan in the Security Council of the United Nations, made it more than evident to the Indian leaders that they not only had to strengthen the Armed Forces but also create sufficient strength of reserves, who could take up arms, when required. The gravity of time and event found expression in the Indian Legislature through anxious and pressing demand for military training of young men and women throughout the country.\n At this juncture, Prime Minister Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru at the behest of Sardar Baldev Singh, the then Defence Minister and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, then Home Minister, took out the Kunzuru Committee Report for a serious studyfrom the shelves of the Defence Department. On 05 Dec 1947, after being approved by the Defence Committee the copy of the Cadet Corps Committee Report was sent to the Chief Secretaries and Chief Commissioners of all Provincial Govts (now called State Govts) for their comments.\n The consent of Provincial Govts were required because they were responsible for the administration of the educational institutions in their respective provinces and thus the success of the Cadet Corps scheme largely depended on their initiative. Replies received from the provinces in Jan 1948, show that they all agreed in principal with the Cadet Corps Scheme submitted by the Kunzuru Committee.\n Inauguration of NCC:\n The schools and colleges opened after summer vacation and the NCC of Independent India was inaugurated on 15 Jul 1948. The journey of this Indian youth organisation, which has now become the largest uniformed youth organisation in the world had begun.\n In the year 1948 a total of 96 units of Senior Division were raised, comprising variety of units to include one Armoured Corps, three Artillery, five Engineers, two Signals and two Medical and 83 companies of Infantry.\n As there was some delay in the establishment of NCC in UP, Madras and Bihar, whose Govts wanted every student joining NCC to be verified by police prior to enrolment, only 20,000 cadets had joined the NCC in the year 1948.\n The raising of the Junior Division units did not progress well owing to shortage of trained school teachers. The main difficulty was that adequate number of teachers of the desired quality did not come forward to work as NCC officers.\n Motto of NCC:\n The need for having motto for the Corps was discussed in the 11th Central Advisory Committee (CAC) meeting held on 11 Aug 1978. The mottos suggested were 'Duty and Discipline'\n 'Duty, Unity and Discipline'; 'Duty and Unity'; 'Unity and Discipline'\n The final decision for selection of 'Unity and Discipline' as motto for the NCC was taken in the 12th CAC meeting held on 12 Oct 1980.\n For further details contact the following N.S.S. Programme Officers.\n NCC Flag:\n The NCC flag for various units of the NCC was first introduced in 1951.\n The flag was of same pattern, colour and size as was used by various regiments of the Army.\n The only difference was that it had the NCC badge and unit designation placed in the centre.\n Later on it was felt that the flag should be in keeping with the inter-service character of the Corps. In 1954 the existing tricolour flag was introduced.\n The three colours in the flag depict the three services of the Corps, red for the Army,deep blue for the Navy and light blue for the Air Force.\n The letters NCC and the NCC crest in gold in the middle of the flag encircled by a wreath of lotus, give the flag a colourful look and a distinct identity.\n History of NCC Song:\n The desirability of composing a NCC song was considered in the Circle Commanders (now called DDGs) Conference held in January 1956 and all circles were asked to send their proposals. The official song of the NCC - 'Kadam Mila Ke Chal' was adopted in 1963, and registered in 1969 with the approval of the Ministry of Defence.\n In 1974, it was felt that the NCC song had failed to catch the imagination of the youth, and there was a need for a change.\n A sustained process began; entries were invited from Directorates for suitable lyrics; 107 entries were received; of which eight were selected by a Board of Officers. However, all the eight were considered sub standard by Dr Nagendra of Delhi University, who was the judge.\n On the suggestion of Dr Nagendra, the task was entrusted to Shri Chiranjit, the Chief Producer, Drama Division, AIR, Delhi.\n The song written by Shri Chiranjit was approved, in 1976. The Maharashtra Directorate was asked to get the song composed and recorded with the help of Shri Raj Kapoor, and the Films Division, Bombay.\n However, nothing much came out of this exercise as Shri Raj Kapoor was then busy in making his film 'Satyam Shivam Sundaram' and the studios of the Films Division were under renovation.\n Later, Shri Mahinder Singh Bedi, a well known poet of Delhi, was requested to write another song. This effort also proved infructuous. AEC Centre Pachmarhi was also approached, but somehow the matter could not be finalized.\n Almost during the same period and independent of efforts at Directorate General NCC, the Film Division undertook production of a documentary on NCC 'A Cadet' s Diary'. The Director of the documentary was looking for a suitable song for the film.\n He happened to hear the song - 'Ham Sab Hindi Hain' which appears to have been first sung at a Youth Festival at Chandigarh, sometime during 1968-69, and introduced it in the documentary film.\n The song was a hit and successive Director Generals (DGs) found it good and played it repeatedly in Republic Day camps. In 1980, the word 'Hindi' was substituted with 'Bhartiya'.\n Come ASIAD (1982), and the NCC got the opportunity to display its potential in the opening ceremony. The Special Organising Committee approved trial recording of the song for recital during the Asian Games Festival.\n The song was finally recorded in its present form, sometime during Oct 1982, at the Western Outdoor Studio, Delhi with the help of AIR artists, and musicians under overall supervision of Pandit Vijai Raghavan Rao.\n Post ASIAD era in the NCC saw among other events, a well composed musical hit and an inspiring NCC song being played and sung alongwith recorded music; a 16 mm colour film had also been made with title 'Hum Sab Bhartiya Hain' of 7 1/2 minutes duration.\n This film had been telecast twice on national hook up. Other films, 'Unity and Discipline'; 'A Cadet' s Diary, had also used this song prominently. The writer of this song seems to have been lost in \n oblivion.\n ‘No body knows’ - said Shri SK Sharma, Joint Director, Armed Forces Film and Photo Division, who was actively involved with the production of documentaries on the NCC. 'This song was not written for the NCC, as such, writes Shri Mathur, ex-publicity officer, DGNCC, in his notings on the file.\n But nobody has claimed it so far. Another noting speaks of Sri Virender Sharma as the lyrics writer, and Sri Vijai Raghavan Rao as the music composer.\n This NCC song is liked by millions of cadets, both past and present, and is sung on all important occasions of the NCC.\n Period Programme Nature of Programme\tParticipation\n 09-03-2022 to 09-03-2022 Blood Donation Programme\tBlood Donation Programme\tPublic\n 02-03-2022 to 02-03-2022\tSpecial Orientation Programme\tSpecial Orientation Programme 29 cadets\n 05-01-2022 to 05-01-2022\tPublic Park cleaning Public Park cleaning\t29 cadets & Rahamath Nagar area people\n 04-01-2022 to 04-01-2022\tCyber Jaagrookta Diwas\tCyber Jaagrookta Diwas\t49 cadets\n 22-12-2021 to 22-12-2021\tLecture on Women in Leadership\tLecture on Women in Leadership\t49 cadets\n 09-12-2021 to 09-12-2021\tHonour of India's Gallantry Awardee Honour of India's Gallantry Awardee 51 cadets, 5 Gallantry awardees and their family members\n 03-12-2021 to 03-12-2021 Cleanliness Drive Cleanliness Drive\t49 cadets & Ariyakulam Village People\n 16-11-2021 to 16-11-2021\tStatue cleaning Statue cleaning\t38 cadets and Palayamkottai people\n 02-11-2021 to 02-11-2021\tVideo Conference to interact with Group Commander\tVideo Conference to interact with Group Commander\t13 Senior Wing Associate NCC Officers\n 08-11-2021 to 08-11-2021\tTree Plantation\tTree Plantation 30 cadets and Ariyakulam Village People\n 23-08-2021 to 26-08-2021 Fit India Freedom Run Fit India Freedom Run 32 cadets\n 08-08-2021 to 08-08-2021 Honour of India Gallantry Awardee\tHonour of India Gallantry Awardee\t15 cadets of SSC , 20 Cadets of St .John's College\n 21-06-2021 to 21-06-2021 Painting competition – SWARNIM VIJAY VARSH Painting competition – SWARNIM VIJAY VARSH\t48 cadets\n 21-06-2021 to 21-08-2021 VII International Yoga Day Yog 28 cadets and their family members\n 16-12-2020 to 16-12-2020\tSWACHTTA PAKWADA SWACHTTA PAKWADA 12 cadets"

            "National Service Scheme (NSS)\nOVERVIEW:\n NSS volunteers generally work with adopted villages, slums and voluntary agencies to complete 120 hours of regular activities during an academic year. As per the fundamental principles of National Service Scheme, a volunteer is expected to remain in constant touch with the community. Special camps are organized generally on various developmental issues of national importance.

            "INTERNAL QUALITY ASSURANCE CELL (IQAC) & Activities \n \n(Reference: NAAC website)\nEvery accredited institution should establish an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) as a post-accreditation quality sustenance measure. Since quality enhancement is a continuous process, the IQAC will become a part of the institution's system and work towards realisation of the goals of quality enhancement and sustenance. The prime task of the IQAC is to develop a system for conscious, consistent and catalytic improvement in the overall performance of institutions. The work of the IQAC is the first step towards internalization and institutionalization of quality enhancement initiatives. It will be a facilitative and participative voluntary system/unit/organ of the institution. It has the potential to become a vehicle for ushering in quality enhancement by working out planned interventionist strategies to remove deficiencies and enhance quality.\nA.Promotion of core values in the Higher Educational Institution:\nContributing to National Development\nFostering Global Competencies among Students\nInculcating a Value System among Students\nPromoting the Use of Technology\nQuest for Excellence\nThe primary aim of IQAC is\nTo develop a system for conscious, consistent and catalytic action to improve the academic and administrative performance of the institution.\nTo promote measures for institutional functioning towards quality enhancement through internalization of quality culture and institutionalization of best practices.\nB. Some functions of the IQAC are:\nDevelopment and application of quality benchmarks/parameters for various academic and administrative activities of the institution;\nFacilitating the creation of a learner-centric environment conducive to quality education and faculty maturation to adopt the required knowledge and technology for participatory teaching and learning process;\nArrangement for feedback response from students, parents and other stakeholders on quality-related institutional processes\nd) Dissemination of information on various quality parameters of higher education;\ne) Organization of inter and intra institutional workshops, seminars on quality related themes and promotion of quality circles;\nf) Documentation of the various programmes/activities leading to quality improvement;\ng) Acting as a nodal agency of the Institution for coordinating quality-related activities, including adoption and dissemination of best practices;\nh) Development and maintenance of institutional database through MIS for the purpose of maintaining /enhancing the institutional quality;\ni) Development of Quality Culture in the institution;\nj) Preparation of the Annual Quality Assurance Report (AQAR) as per guidelines and parameters of NAAC, to be submitted to NAAC.\nThe composition of the IQAC may be as follows:\nPost-Accreditation Quality Initiatives\n. Optimal utilisation of Expertise of senior faculty members: As per the recommendations and directives of the honourable Peer Team members, IQAC identify and integrate the retired faculty members from Universities, Institutes and Colleges in various departments to sustain the academic quality and research quality. Institution, being unaided faced very frequent appointment/relief of teachers and it led to inconsistency in the academic delivery at times. Being a women institution due to their marriage, migration and other reasons the institution incurred such difficulties. IQAC suggests holding and keeping senior professors retired to be appointed in all the post graduate departments. With this arrangement the institution is engaging retired subject experts from various universities in the department of English, Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Commerce and Computer applications. This practice enhanced the research initiatives in most departments and the young teachers of the institution too are imbibed with right work culture, teaching methodology and approach to the young minds by way of their interaction with senior teachers.\n2. Intelligent use of technology: COVID Pandemic being blessing and disguise, bred the ICT culture ubiquitously in all the departments with the teacher and taught sufficiently. Before the second cycle itself all the faculty members were subjected to practice Teaching-Learning through ICT mode. It was in a budding stage. Immediately after reaccreditation, most teachers were encouraged, trained, practiced, familiarized and adopted the methodology with computer based teaching with LCD/Smart board. Subsequently the management provided LCD to all departments and fixed at final year class rooms for day to day use. All final year students under autonomy have to take seminars in the respective courses as a part of CIA evaluation. Presently it helped a lot and all faculty members and students are empowered with this user friendly technology. The quality of learning and understanding had considerably increased.\nSTEERING COMMITTEE\nS.No Capacity\tName\tDesignation\n1. Chair Person\tDr.(Smt) N. Kamala\t\n2.

            "Science Lab\nOVERVIEW:\nA laboratory is a facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific or technological research, experiments, and measurement may be performed. In our college we have defined well established laboratories in the departments of Physics, Chemistry, Computer science etc.\n\nPERSONAL AND GENERAL LABORATORY SAFETY:\nNever eat or drink anything while working in the laboratory.\nRead labels carefully.\nDo not use any equipment unless you are trained and approved as a user by your supervisor.\nWear safety glasses or face shields when working with hazardous materials and/or equipment.\nWear gloves when using any hazardous or toxic agent.\nClothing: When handling dangerous substances, wear gloves, laboratory coats, and safety shield or glasses.\nIf you have long hair or loose clothes, make sure it is tied back or confined.\nKeep the work area clear of all materials except those needed for your work. Coats should be hung in the hall or placed in a locker. Extra books, purses, etc. should be kept away from equipment that requires air flow or ventilation to prevent overheating.\nStudents are responsible for the proper disposal of used material if any in appropriate containers.\nIf a piece of equipment fails while being used, report it immediately to your lab assistant or tutor. Never try to fix the problem yourself because you could harm yourself and others.\nIf leaving a lab unattended, turn off all ignition sources and lock the doors.\nClean up your work table area before leaving.\nWash hands before leaving the lab and before eating.\nAvoid wastage of water and use judiciously.\nELECTRICAL SAFETY\nObtain permission before operating any high voltage equipment.\nMaintain an unobstructed access to all electrical panels.\nWiring or other electrical modifications must be referred to the Electronics Shop or the Building Coordinator.\nAvoid using extension cords whenever possible. If you must use one, obtain a heavy-duty one that is electrically grounded, with its own fuse, and install it safely. Extension cords should not go under doors, across aisles, be hung from the ceiling, or plugged into other extension cords.\nNever, ever modify, attach or otherwise change any high voltage equipment.\nAlways make sure all capacitors are discharged (using a grounded cable with an insulating handle) before touching high voltage leads or the 'inside' of any equipment even after it has been turned off. Capacitors can hold charge for many hours after the equipment has been turned off.\nWhen you are adjusting any high voltage equipment or a laser which is powered with a high voltage supply, USE ONLY ONE HAND. Your other hand is best placed in a pocket or behind your back. This procedure eliminates the possibility of an accident where high voltage current flows up one arm, through your chest, and down the other arm.\nCHEMICAL SAFETY\nTreat every chemical as if it were hazardous.\nMake sure all chemicals are clearly and currently labeled with the substance name, concentration, date, and name of the individual responsible.\nNever return chemicals to reagent bottles. (Try for the correct amount and share any excess.)\nComply with fire regulations concerning storage quantities, types of approved containers and cabinets, proper labeling, etc.\nUse volatile and flammable compounds only in a fume hood. Procedures that produce aerosols should be performed in a hood to prevent inhalation of hazardous material.\nNever allow a solvent to come in contact with your skin. Always use gloves.\nNever 'smell' a solvent!! Read the label on the solvent bottle to identify its contents.\nDispose of waste and broken glassware in proper containers.\nClean up spills immediately.\nDo not store food in laboratory refrigerators.\nADDITIONAL SAFETY GUIDELINES\nNever do unauthorized experiments.\nNever work alone in the laboratory.\nKeep your table and lab space clean and organized.\nDo not leave an on-going experiment unattended.\nAlways inform your instructor if you break a thermometer. Do not clean mercury yourself!!\nNever taste anything. Never pipette by mouth; use a bulb.\nNever use open flames in laboratory.\nCheck your glassware for cracks each time while you use it. Cracks could cause the glassware to fail during use and cause serious injury to you or lab mates\nMaintain unobstructed access to all exits, fire extinguishers, electrical panels, emergency showers, and eye washes.\nDo not use corridors for storage or work areas.\nDo not store heavy items above table height. Any overhead storage of supplies on top of cabinets should be limited to lightweight items only.\nAreas containing lasers, biohazards, radioisotopes, and carcinogens should be used carefully.\nBe careful when lifting heavy objects or glass containers.\nClean your lab bench and equipment, and lock the door before you leave the laboratory.\nRULES AND REGULATIONS\nSome of the abilities which may be developed and evaluated during practical work are the following\nto handle equipments.\nto design and conduct experiments\nto tabulate and classify the data\nto draw tentative inferences.\nStudents should understand the theory behind the reactions they carry out. They will turn out to be better analysts if they have a full understanding of what they are doing.\nStudents who happen to be absent for a practical should do it before the next practical is held. They will not be permitted to do it afterwards.\nStudents should carry out the experiments, take the readings, do the calculations and write their observations independently. Consulting others or copying from neighbors is strictly prohibited.\nLaboratory work shall be assessed continuously in every practical class.\nPart of the practical examination mark will be allotted for the practical's done during the year and for the record maintenance. The external examiners will scrutinize the practical record note book maintained and award mark on the basis of the records. Hence submission of record notebooks and observation note books on the date and time mentioned by the teachers concerned is imperative.\nThe external examination will be conducted with two external examiners. The external practical examination for all U.G. & P.G. Courses will be conducted at the end of even semesters only.\nGreat care should be taken by students in handling the costly apparatus of the laboratory. All breakages, damages, losses etc. as soon as they happened must be reported to the concerned lecturer. The cost of things broken, damaged or lost will be recovered from the students at the current market rates.\nStudents should pay the breakage charges at the end of the year. Failure to do so will be penalized by non-issue of hall ticket.\nLANGUAGE LABORATORY\nThe Department of English has a digital Language Lab for the benefit of the development of their pronunciation. It is highly useful for the students to explicate their communication skills. The digital Language Lab is beneficial for the literature students to acquire a complete perception / learning in their prescribed literary plays through CDs. The students of all disciplines are trained on the digital Language Lab once in a week, with a follow up for a week."

It's the perfect energy source for running buildings that serve thousands of people while being economical and environmentally benign. Colleges serve as hubs for cutting-edge learning and as stepping stones to the future. Solar power undoubtedly has a promising future because it lowers energy costs, reduces existing greenhouse gas emissions, and offers a sustainable design. We have solar panels on the walking platform on our campus. The total capacity is 125 kW per month. This meets around 35 percent of our total energy demand. The energy from solar panels is used to fuel its street lights, and light up hostels. Solar power is beginning to power classrooms, dormitories, and canteens of multitudes of educational institutions\n\nThe main benefits of solar panels in college are greater access to hands-on learning opportunities, a healthier environment, and cleaner air through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Other benefits are:\nFree energy from the sun will eventually cover installation and material costs, resulting in a quick return on investment.\nSolar energy is more environmentally benign than energy derived from finite fossil fuels because it is an endless source of energy.\nSolar panels may be able to function independently of the conventional grid, which could be useful in the event of a utility power outage.\nThey require less maintenance after installation, which is another significant advantage. The glass and frame that shield solar cells are incredibly sturdy and long-lasting.\nBecause millennial are largely in favour of green energy, adding solar panels to a college's roof can boost student enrolment. Young people who wish to take part in project solar energy are interested in two environmental topics: tax credits from the government and cheaply produced solar panels."

            "CONSUMER CARE CONSORTIUM\n\n'The customer is the most important visitor on our premises. He is not dependent on us. We are dependent on him. He is not an interruption on our work. He is the purpose of it. He is not an outsider on our business. He is part of it. We are not doing him a favour by serving him. He is doing us a favour by giving us an opportunity to do so' - MAHATMA GANDHI\n\nCONSUMER CULTURE: The changing consumption pattern is not only confined to the urban areas but is going deep down to the rural markets too. A consumer is a person or group of people who are the final users of products and or services generated within a social system. The terms 'consumer' and 'customer' are often used interchangeably, but a consumer and customer are not always the same. In brief, consumers use products, while customers buy them. A consumer may also be a customer and a customer can also be a consumer.\n\nCONSUMER EDUCATION: It encourages critical thinking, which helps consumers function more efficiently in the marketplace, promotes self-confidence and independence, imparts life skills which contribute to success in everyday living and improves the quality of life as well as environment. It has been observed that the people for whom various schemes have been taken up by Bureau of Indian Standards, in fact, do not get benefit as expected. This is mainly because they are not fully aware of these schemes and their benefits.\n\nCONSUMER CARE CONSORTIUM: In this regard, the Consumer Care Consortium under the Institutional Social Responsibility initiative takes the first and the foremost step on a consumer to prevent himself from cheating to keep his eyes and ears open. This is the mission part of the volunteers of CCC of this institution. Hence, the role of the voluntary consumer organizations, consumer activists, non-governmental organizations, educational institutions and media are vital and valuable.

This is the mission part of the volunteers of CCC of this institution. Hence, the role of the voluntary consumer organizations, consumer activists, non-governmental organizations, educational institutions and media are vital and valuable.\n\nTHE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT,1986 was an Act of the Parliament of India enacted to protect the interests of consumers in India. It was replaced by the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (CPA) is an Act that provides for effective protection of interests of consumers and as such makes provision for the establishment of consumer councils and other authorities that help in settlement of consumer disputes and matters connected therewith. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and the new Act of 2019 was enacted to provide a simple and quick solution to consumers for their grievances against any deficiency in services or defect in goods. It protects the various rights of the consumers against the seller or service provider. The main objectives of the act are to provide better protection to customers and effective safeguard against different types of exploitation like defective merchandise, deficient services and unfair trade practices.\n\nRIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONSUMERS:\n\na) The eight consumer rights are: The right to satisfaction of basic needs - to have access to basic, essential goods and services such as adequate food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, public utilities, water and sanitation.\nb) The five responsibilities are Critical Awareness, Action, Social Concern, Environmental Awareness and Solidarity.\nNATIONAL CONSUMER HELPLINE: The Department has launched a National Help Line. The toll free number 1800-11-4000 facility is available to consumers from 9.30 A.M. to 5.30 P.M. on all the working days."
